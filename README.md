## Installing the Web app as executable on the machine :
- First of all, you need to install _npm_ (Node package manager) and by extension _Node.js_ on your machine. On windows, you can install the packages From the Node.js Downloads page. To do so on MacOS/Linux, type this command in the terminal :
```
npm install -g npm
```
- Check _npm_ and _Node.js_ installations using these commands :
```
node -v
npm -v
```
